# CityBlocs with Meteor.js

**This is currently non-functional, pre-alpha software**

The existing site is live at [cityblocs.ca](http://www.cityblocs.ca/), though
its source is not currently available. The goal of this project is to launch an
open-source, reusable version that includes enhanced functionality over the
relatively static content of the current site.

## Quickstart ##

    $ git clone https://github.com/centralitydata/CityBlocs-Meteor.git cityblocs
    $ cd cityblocs
    $ meteor

Then browse to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start your own
CityBlocs distribution. Just don't expect to much of it yet!

## Meteor packages ##

We are currently using these Meteor packages:
  * accounts-password
  * accounts-ui
  * iron:router
  * markdown
  * meteor-platform
  * twbs:bootstrap
